# FF3jPR-All-Jobs
A mod for the Magicite framework of FF3j Pixel Remaster to unlock all jobs upon touching the wind crystal.


# Notes:

Ideally there will be two versions of this mod. One which has basic gear (your starting gear) equippable by all jobs for ease of progression in the early points of the game, and one which simply unlocks all jobs upon touching the crystal. No other aspects of the game in its entirety are modified.



# Installation:

Place the folder into "\FINAL FANTASY III PR\FINAL FANTASY III_Data\StreamingAssets\Magicite\" (The Magicite Folder will need to be created if it doesn't exist yet) after placing [BepinEX](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/download/v6.0.0-pre.2/BepInEx-Unity.IL2CPP-win-x64-6.0.0-pre.2.zip), and [Magicite](https://github.com/Silvris/Magicite/releases/tag/v2.2.0) into the root FF3j Folder (ex: steamapps\common\FINAL FANTASY III PR\). Making a quicksave before touching the wind crystal to ensure things are functioning properly is suggested, but not required.

# A Small Note:

Thank you to PJ (TheSuperSNES) for indirectly getting us back into rooting through a game's innards to make funny things again, we've missed doing things like this.
